## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **JavaScript Carousel Logic**

   - The script dynamically updates the position and visibility of animal cards.
   - Clicking “Next” or “Previous” shifts the currently active card.
   - Only the current, previous, and next cards are visible — others are moved offscreen for performance.

2. **CSS Transitions**

   - Smooth scaling, opacity, and blur transitions give the carousel a 3D depth feel.

3. **Navigation**
   - Header links (HOME, ABOUT, WATCH, CONTACT) are placeholders for future routing or expansion.
